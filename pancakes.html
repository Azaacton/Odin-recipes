        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book.</p>
        <p>Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. 
                Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. 
                Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
